== Installation ==

= Simple installation =

The CrowdHandler plugin is available to install via the WordPress plugin directory.

= Manual installation =

1. Download the CrowdHandler plugin as a zip file
1. Unzip `crowdhandler-wordpress.zip`
1. Upload the `crowdhandler-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Configuration =

After installation, you need to configure the plugin:

1. Access the settings page at `[yoursite.com]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=crowdhandler`
1. Get your CrowdHandler API Public Key from the [CrowdHandler admin interface](https://admin.crowdhandler.com/account/api)
1. Add your CrowdHandler API Public Key in the field labelled "Public Key"
1. Check the "enabled" option. This will activate CrowdHandler for the site.
1. Configure optional settings
1. Select "Save Settings"

Optional settings:

* **Override index.php**: activating this option allows CrowdHandler to run in place of your WordPress website's default homepage. If you do not wish to do this, then your own server will take the load for all traffic to the homepage. For periods of very high demand, this may not be ideal.
